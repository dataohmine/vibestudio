# VibeStudio 🎨

**A visual coding platform for kids to learn programming through animations and art!**

VibeStudio is a Scratch-like visual programming environment designed to make coding fun and accessible for children. Kids can create animations, games, and interactive art by dragging and dropping code blocks instead of typing complex syntax.

## ✨ Features

### 🧩 Visual Block Programming
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Easy-to-use visual blocks for all programming concepts
- **Real-time Code Preview**: See the JavaScript code generated from your visual blocks
- **Educational**: Bridge between visual programming and real coding

### 🎭 Interactive Stage
- **Animated Sprite**: Watch your 🐶 poodle character come to life
- **Real-time Feedback**: See your code execute immediately
- **Speech Bubbles**: Characters can talk and think with your programs

### 🎮 Kid-Friendly Projects
- **Interactive Games**: Virtual pets, catching games, snake game
- **Creative Art**: Magic wands, disco parties, music visualizers
- **Learning Focused**: Each project teaches specific programming concepts

### 🎯 Programming Concepts Covered
- **Events**: Mouse clicks, keyboard input, program start
- **Motion**: Movement, rotation, positioning, bouncing
- **Control Flow**: Loops, conditionals, timing
- **Variables**: Sprite properties, user input
- **Functions**: Reusable code blocks

## 🚀 Getting Started
